# Gearbox Pools - Diesel Token - Collateral Plugin

## Summary

This plugin allows users who provided liquidity to a Gearbox Pool to use their Diesel Tokens (dTokens) as collateral in the Reserve Protocol.

`dTokens` will accrue revenue from the credit accounts' farming activity by increasing their exchange rate over the pool's token.
